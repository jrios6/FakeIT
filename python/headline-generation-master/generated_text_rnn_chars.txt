beverly hills  calif  as she made for her booth  tucked into a remote corner of the blvd lounge at the beverly wilshire hotel here  isabelle huppert expertly dodged the furtive stares of a roomful of diners she had arrived on the arm of her publicist  who vanished as discreetly as he had arrived  leaving ms huppert on her own to sit with a reporter  sip her cappuccino and ponder a question is she vain brusquely  she picked up a knife  inspecting her reflection in its blade is this what you mean she asked lightly  brushing aside a stray wisp of hair was she being coy hard to say ambiguity  after all  is ms hupperts stock in trade it is part of the screen arsenal she has deployed in more than 100 films during the course of a  career  and it is central to her role in elle  a  psychological thriller in which she  as the victim of a vicious rape  responds with an eerie admixture of horror and calm her performance  which earned her a best actress award at the golden globes in january  drew fresh waves of attention when she was nominated this month for an academy award  an honor she seems to regard with a mix of anxiety and cool entitlement would she bring home oscar gold on sunday night yeah  its possible  she ventured  adding definitively after a pause  yes  for me its time  that near boast  tempered by a flicker of amusement  hinted at the wickedly subversive streak that has made ms huppert a muse to an international roster of directors  including claude chabrol  otto preminger  bertrand tavernier and paul verhoeven mr verhoeven  of basic instinct and showgirls notoriety  directed ms huppert in elle  combined with an apparently uncontrived chic  that subversiveness has lately transformed ms huppert  who is mostly known in the united states to an art house crowd  into a red carpet diva and the unlikely darling of the fashion set never mind that ms huppert  63  long married and the mother of three  plays a grandmother in elle  or that in her native paris she has long been a  fixture at dior  chanel and armani when the cameras closed in on her as she claimed her globe  writers breathlessly anatomized every facet of her look as the popular who what wear website effusively reported  her incredibly chic  top and skirt along with an earful of edgy repossi ear cuffs have landed the actress on a number of best dressed lists and left the internet buzzing  the fashion law  another widely read blog  posted  it is difficult not to notice that huppert is becoming a favorite not only of critics and fashion industry insiders but of those on the periphery  as well  adding her voice to the mix  vanessa friedman  the new york times fashion critic  posted on twitter on the night of the globes  whoever made isabelle hupperts dress should take credit asap  ms huppert had selected that dress  armani prive  with care its important how personal and singular you feel in what you wear  she said its important that you keep your own identity  would she turn up again in armani on oscar night i might  she offered playfully whether she is captured on camera in a  trouser suit  as she was at the los angeles film critics association awards in january in a chloe gown at the british academy film awards this month or in a pale blue trouser suit  snapped alongside nicole kidman on the day they received their oscar nominations  ms huppert projects a singular authority she has what the french used to call chien  said simon doonan  the creative ambassador for barneys new york he was alluding to the blend of tough chic and barely concealed sensuality that  mr doonan maintains  defines ms hupperts allure and in viewing her image on instagram  ryan lobo  a designer of the new york label tome  responded with a single word queen  on instagram  ms huppert is followed by no less a fashion personage than nicolas ghesquiyre  the creative director of louis vuitton in an interview with the hollywood reporter  jonathan huguet  her stylist  summed up her appeal as a rare combination of masculine assurance and unexpected fragility she is hardly indifferent to fashion  mr huguet noted she knows her brands and designers  he said she is completely open to different things  he added that she was happy to try a variety of fabrics  shapes and designers  among them haider ackermann and maria grazia chiuri of dior still  the style worlds renewed devotion has left ms huppert nonplused after all  she said  a bit disingenuously  im not a fashion person  she had dressed for breakfast at the beverly wilshire in a crisply tailored jacket  its deep green and coral pattern setting off her  russet hair who designed the jacket her features furrowed briefly as she removed it to check the label  exclaiming with what seemed genuine surprise its j crew can you imagine the jacket  which she wore over a pale coral chloe blouse and slim trousers  was consistent with a style ms huppert has refined over time  a look that is mostly defined by slim trousers  tailored jackets and coats  understated evening wear  and the occasional provocative accent  those tiny repossi cuffs snaking up her ear  immaculately assembled as they may be  her ensembles are worn with the effortlessness that frenchwomen seem to naturally possess  allyson payer of who what wear posted it is the kind of assessment that ms huppert is apt to greet with one of her ironic smiles because im french  people have a certain idea of my style  she said im not quite sure what that means and not quite sure what it is that im supposed to represent  when shes not acting  she said  i dont think of myself as carrying a specific image  but on camera  she added every change of outfit can help you it allows you to see yourself freshly each time  and each time with fresh potential  there are times  it seems  when ms huppert is all potential  her aloof  sometimes opaque  expression  resting bitch face  as the fashion tribes would have it  acting as a potent draw its intrinsic to her  that certain enigmatic je ne sais quoi  mr doonan said if her mystery tends to mesmerize devout fashionistas  its not for the first time ms huppert herself is well aware that she has long fascinated fashion photographers  among them richard avedon  guy bourdin  helmut newton  hedi slimane and their illustrious like her face is like a window  its so transparent  said peter lindbergh  who has shot her many times when you photograph people  often that window is closed some people let you in  but there is a limit but isabelle  she is like glass  she also has a chameleonlike quality that was captured in 2005 in a show of her portraits at moma ps1  subsequently gathered in book form  that volume  like the show  aptly titled  isabelle huppert woman of many faces  perhaps most famously  she posed   for newton wearing a white bathrobe that opened to expose a sliver of nipple  her expression in that instant a disconcerting blend of innocence and insolence her face  she knows  can be a difficult read most of the time it is more like a white canvas on which you can project many things  she said i wouldnt say its inexpressive  but it is undefined enough that it can be shaped and defined by whoever looks at you  she laughed in the end something that could be seen as a fault turns out to be an advantage  she said however malleable her features  however vulnerable she may seem onscreen  ms huppert wants you to know that ultimately she is the one in charge i play a role  but i dont transform myself entirely  she said the irony you see  the humor  the way of being cool  its me more than anyone else  i have to say  some take it for perversity  a trait that has marked her since she appeared onscreen in the early 2000s as the  sadomasochistic antiheroine of the erotic thriller the piano teacher  what people call perverse and outside the margins  it has nothing to do with perversity  ms huppert said its more about doing one thing and maybe thinking another thats what we all do  and thats what you see in me on film  nor does she  in her acting  make an effort to seduce im not really interested in pleasing  she said in her teasing contralto i think the best way to please is not to please  that refusal is one source of a sexual charisma that can defy analysis i dont use the usual seductive tools  ms huppert said my sexuality is almost cerebral its never  look at me  see how sexy i am  on the screen she is permitted an erotic latitude not generally available to her contemporaries  in particular meryl streep  with whom she is often  if misguidedly  compared as michyle in elle  ms huppert pursues her own sexual agenda  whatever the cost in a recent fashion feature in the reporter  she comes off as a steamy   vixen  aptly costumed in  black leather she is also permitted a display of  that doesnt quite square with the sexual hunger she is sometimes asked to portray on film some call it coldness  a brechtian detachment  as mr verhoeven remarked  or a chilly reflection of  does that translate to vanity ms huppert wondered  returning to a topic that she clearly finds absorbing if it does  i dont care
