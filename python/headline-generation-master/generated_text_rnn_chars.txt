mount vernon  va  the costumed characters at george washingtons gracious estate here are used to handling all manner of awkward queries  whether about  privies or the first presidents teeth so when a visitor recently asked an in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew ona judge  the woman didnt miss a beat judges escape from the presidential residence in philadelphia in 1796 had been a great embarrassment to general and lady washington  the woman said  before offering her own view of the matter ona was born free  like everybody  she said it was this world that made her a slave  its always 1799 at mount vernon  where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before washingtons death  when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves that liberation did not apply to ona judge  one of 153 slaves held by martha washington but judge  it turned out  evaded the washingtons dogged  and sometimes illegal  efforts to recapture her  and would live quietly in new hampshire for another 50 years now her story  and the challenge it offers to the notion that washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding  is having its fullest airing yet judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in lives bound together slavery at george washingtons mount vernon  the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic she is also the subject of a book  never caught the washingtons relentless pursuit of their runaway slave  ona judge  by erica armstrong dunbar most scholars who have written about judges escape have used it as a lens onto washingtons evolving ideas about slavery but never caught  published on tuesday by 37 ink  flips the perspective  focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage we have the famous fugitives  like harriet tubman and frederick douglass  ms dunbar  a professor of black studies and history at the university of delaware  said in an interview in mount vernons  food court but decades before them  ona judge did this i want people to know her story  research on slavery has exploded in the two decades since mount vernon  monticello and other founder home sites introduced  tours and other prominent acknowledgments of the enslaved lives bound together  which runs through september 2018  was originally going to fill one  room in the museum here  but soon expanded to include six other galleries normally dedicated to the decorative and fine arts  books and manuscripts we had so much material  and its such an important story  susan p schoelwer  the curator at mount vernon  said we realized we could take many of the objects already on view and reframe them  the exhibition makes it clear just who poured from the elegant teapots and did the backbreaking work on the  estate but integrating the harsh reality of slavery into the heroic story of washington  a leader of character  as the title of the permanent exhibition across from the slavery show calls him  remains unfinished work  some scholars say hes a much more mythic figure than jefferson  said annette  the author of the hemingses of monticello and a harvard professor many people want to see him as perfect in some way  but his determined pursuit of judge  she said  as much as his will freeing his slaves  reflects the basic  of slave owners its saying  whatever i might think about slavery in the abstract  i should be able to do what i want with my property  she said ms dunbar  the author of never caught  first came across ona judge in the late 1990s  when she was a graduate student at columbia researching free black women in philadelphia one day in the archives  she noticed a 1796 newspaper ad offering 10 for the return of a light mulatto girl  much freckled  with very black eyes and bushy hair who had absconded from the presidents house i said to myself here i am  a scholar in this field why dont i know about her  ms dunbar recalled since then  judges story has inspired several childrens books  and even an episode of drunk history  but never caught is the first  nonfiction account  drawing on some newly unearthed sources to track her from mount vernon to new york city  philadelphia and then new hampshire  at a time when gradual abolition left the line between slavery and freedom ambiguous theres a myth of the north as free  but her story shows how complicated that was  ms dunbar said it is in the meticulous ledgers of mount vernon that we first see ona maria judge  who was born around 1773 to an enslaved mother and a father who was a white indentured servant at age 9 she was brought to live in the mansion house  eventually becoming martha washingtons personal maid when washington became president  judge followed the first couple to new york and then philadelphia  home to a growing free black community free blacks  ms dunbar writes  aided judges escape in the midst of a presidential dinner  after she had learned that she was to be given to martha washingtons granddaughter  eliza and it was free blacks who helped her catch a sailing ship to portsmouth  n h where she married  had three children and lived on the edge of poverty  laboring in households far less exalted than the washingtons in two interviews published in abolitionist newspapers shortly before her death in 1848  judge testified to the desire for freedom that drove her to run away from the washington household  where she had never received the least moral or mental instruction  she said judges story  ms dunbar said  explodes any notion of privileged house slaves  or of the benevolence of the washingtons  whose far from passive role in perpetuating slavery  and in doling out sometimes brutal punishment to the rebellious  is described in detail ms dunbar describes how the washingtons quietly maneuvered around pennsylvanias 1780 gradual abolition law  rotating their slaves in and out of the state every six months and she recounts their shock at the ingratitude of judge  who fled without any provocation  the president wrote after hearing that judge was in portsmouth  washington  offering a story that she had been enticed away by a frenchman  discreetly sent a federal customs officer to bring her back  circumventing procedures laid out in the 1793 fugitive slave law he himself had signed when judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on marthas death  george washington dismissed her demand as totally inadmissible  however much he might favor general emancipation  he wrote to the customs officer  granting judge any say in her fate would only reward unfaithfulness and give ideas to others far more deserving of favor  in august 1799  washington  through another associate  tried again to capture her  but was foiled when judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared four months later washington was dead  freeing all his slaves in his will judge and the others held by martha washington remained her legal property ms dunbar calls washingtons act no small thing  but does not see the former president  who had no biological children to disinherit  as the hero of the story when it was safe  he emancipated his slaves  she said he dealt with it after his death and you know what thats what all the founders did with slavery they kicked the can down the road
