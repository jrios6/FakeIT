And while most of the international forces with an interest in Syria are keen to exclusively blame one side or the other, civilians in both sides’ neighborhoods are being killed. Russia has paused their airstrikes against Aleppo over the past couple of weeks, though an escalation in fighting further west has meant civilian casualties have continued, with reports of chlorine gas attacks by Nusra forces against government-held areas.

They have been giving her money and paying for speeches for some time now. Get ready for Hillary's *actual* policies to kick in if and when she gets elected. Ironic. GS has been a target of political activism for years. Now they can bank on Hillary protecting them. Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President He’s with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein—an endorsement she had been working toward for years. As was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. On October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for “political reasons” because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, “There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” The anti-Bernie anti-Thesis",english,2016-10-28T02:09:15.029+03:00,CNN,4,US,18533,Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President,0,http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats11.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,0.430279911,unsure,0.520186782,unsure,unsure

Hollywood star Seagal and judo-loving Kremlin tough guy Putin have struck up a bromance in recent years, with Seagal visiting Russia repeatedly and defending Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. ‘He was asking quite insistently and over a lengthy period to be granted citizenship,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. ‘He is well known for his warm feelings towards our country and has never hidden them.’ DUAL CITIZENSHIP IN THE U.S. Americans are allowed to hold dual citizenship, such as Steven Seagal now has with Russia. U.S. law does not mention dual nationality not does it require its citizens to choose one nationality over the other. People that become U.S. citizens are asked to make a pledge of loyalty to the U.S., renouncing all previous allegiances, but the statement is more symbolic than contractual. However, there are rare cases in which a U.S. citizen can forfeit their citizenship by becoming the citizen of another nation. That can happen in instances when an American citizen joins the armed forces of a foreign nation or they make a declaration of allegiance to a foreign state with the express purpose of relinquishing their U.S. nationality. Seagal is the latest in a string of high-profile Westerners to be granted Russian citizenship after buddying up with Putin. Veteran French actor Gerard Depardieu was given a Russian passport in 2013 after the star became a tax exile in ire over rate hikes in his native country. Putin has also handed out citizenship to American boxer Roy Jones Jr after sipping tea with him in Crimea and to American mixed martial artist Jeff Monson. Seagal’s fame peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s with films such as ‘Under Siege’ and ‘Above the Law’, but he remains hugely popular in eastern Europe and was granted Serbian citizenship in January. Like Depardieu, he has previously hung out with Putin, a fellow martial arts fan, and other strongmen leaders from the former Soviet Union. After Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Seagal called Putin ‘one of the great living world leaders’ and even performed with his blues band in the annexed Black Sea peninsula. In August, veteran Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko made Seagal eat one of his homegrown carrots in an awkward encounter that drew mockery online.",english,2016-11-03T21:03:58.143+02:00,The Straits Times,1,US,,Putin grants Steven Seagal Russian citizenship,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/article-doc-hq4yp-vCzQrrGoE078947232bf09aa4ef-869_634x427.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,0.745529652,impartial,0.955393374,impartial,rumor
