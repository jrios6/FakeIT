And while most of the international forces with an interest in Syria are keen to exclusively blame one side or the other, civilians in both sides’ neighborhoods are being killed. Russia has paused their airstrikes against Aleppo over the past couple of weeks, though an escalation in fighting further west has meant civilian casualties have continued, with reports of chlorine gas attacks by Nusra forces against government-held areas.

The news outlet described them as “separate sources” within the agency. Agents have interviewed several people involved in the foundation case, looking for possible pay-to-play links between then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The White Collar Crime division of the FBI is conducting the investigation. “There is an avalanche of new information coming in every day,” a source told Fox News. Sources, meanwhile, told Fox that FBI agents collected a significant amount of evidence even before WikiLeaks started releasing emails linked to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. As FBI agents are “actively and aggressively pursuing this case,” they’ll interview the same people again—possibly some for a third time, the report stated. They’ll also look into what Hillary Clinton and her aides told them in previous interviews. While on the air, Fox News reporter Bret Baier, citing unnamed sources, said that Clinton’s private email server has been breached by at least five separate foreign intelligence hackers. “I pressed again and again on this very issue, and these sources said, ‘Yes, the investigations will continue’” if Clinton defeats rival Donald Trump on Election Day, Baier said on Fox News. “And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they’ll continue to likely an indictment,” Baier added .",english,2016-11-03T21:04:00.760+02:00,AM TV Media,US,,Report: FBI’s Clinton Foundation Probe Will ‘Likely’ Lead to Indictment,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-460497956-676x450.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,0.757945836,impartial,0.815784931,impartial,rumor

Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem “was and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.” The al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory.

Her stated intention was to protest racial oppression.If the anthem is a symbol of racial oppression, then why would she sing it at all?“We’re being unjustly killed and overly criminalized,” Lawrence explained in a Facebook post from Saturday night. “I took the opportunity to sing and kneel to show that we belong in this country and that we have the right to respectfully protest injustices against us.”According to Miami Heat staff, there was no advanced warning that Lawrence was wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt nor that she had plans to kneel.“I didn’t get paid to sing the national anthem nor was this moment about any sort of fame,” Lawrence wrote. “Black Lives Matter is far larger than a hashtag, it’s a rallying cry.”Delivered by The Daily SheepleWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ).",english,2016-10-26T22:05:12.355+03:00,The Daily Sheeple,US,6659,Why Even Sing?

Information recovered from the laptops could only be used in the email investigation and not in others. As part of the immunity agreement, the FBI and Justice Department agreed to destroy Mills’ and Samuelson’s devices, a revelation that sparked outrage from congressional Republicans when it was announced earlier this month. The Journal’s report largely confirms reporting in August from The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Richard Pollock that the FBI and several U.S. attorneys offices were conducting an unorthodox, joint investigation into the Clinton Foundation. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: FBI-US Attorneys Conducting Joint Probe Of Clinton Foundation) CNN reported at around the same time that a Clinton Foundation probe was tabled by the Justice Department. Pollock’s report and the new piece from The Journal undermine CNN’s reporting. While the investigation has gone forward, the Justice Department has stymied the investigation at several turns, according to The Journal. The DOJ refused to grant the FBI the power to issue subpoenas or conduct formal interviews. It also refused to convene a grand jury to weigh evidence in the case. More pushback occurred in August, when a senior DOJ official contacted the FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, to voice his displeasure that New York field office agents were continuing the investigation even though the DOJ had declined to provide investigative support. The official was “very pissed off” that the FBI was continuing its efforts, according to The Journal. The call occurred on Aug. 12, a day after CNN reported details of FBI-DOJ discord over whether to investigate the Clinton Foundation. It was also a day after Pollock reported that an investigation was underway. McCabe figures prominently in The Journal’s reporting and in the overlapping Clintonworld investigations. It was revealed last week that McCabe’s wife, Jill, received nearly $470,000 in contributions to a Virginia state senate campaign last year from Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s super PAC. McAuliffe is a close Clinton ally and is the subject of a separate FBI investigation. According to The Journal, McCabe refocused the Clinton Foundation investigation a week after FBI director James Comey announced in early July that he would recommend to the Justice Department that charges not be filed against Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails. The charity probe would be led by the FBI’s New York office with help from the Little Rock office, according to The Journal. FBI field offices in Los Angeles and Washington were also involved in the Clinton Foundation investigation. The Los Angeles office subpoenaed bank records related to the Clinton Foundation after obtaining information during a separate public corruption case. The office in Washington was investigating McAuliffe’s financial relationships from before he joined the Clinton Foundation as a board member. After Comey’s announcement on the Clinton email investigation in July, McCabe decided that the Washington FBI office would focus on the separate McAuliffe matter. He recused himself from that investigation because of the donations his wife received from McAuliffe’s super PAC in 2015. While the FBI has insisted that McCabe is not compromised in any of the investigations — the email probe, the Clinton Foundation, or the McAuliffe matter — The Journal reports that some agents believe he has issued “stand down” orders in the Clinton Foundation inquiry. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch looks on after announcing federal action related to North Carolina, at the U.S. Department of Justice (Getty Images) That claim came from FBI agents lower on the chain of command from senior-level officials. Still other sources denied that McCabe issued a “stand down” order. They asserted that McCabe ordered investigators to continue on their investigative path. McCabe’s Aug. 12 phone conversation with the senior DOJ official would seem to suggest that he supported the investigation. “Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?” McCabe asked the DOJ official, according to a Journal source who was familiar with the conversation. “Of course not,” the official reportedly said, after a brief pause. The new report also details a presentation that FBI officials made to the Justice Department in February to lay out the case against the Clinton Foundation. Some of the Journal’s sources said that the DOJ’s career public integrity prosecutors did not believe that the case was strong. “Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case,” The Journal reported. DOJ officials told the FBI at the meeting additional investigative tools — subpoenas, interviews or a grand jury — would not be authorized.",english,2016-11-01T19:08:59.936+02:00,AM TV Media,US,,DOJ Tried Repeatedly To Kill FBI’s Clinton Foundation Investigation,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-10-28T181331Z_1_LYNXNPEC9R196_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON-620x413.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,0.384498239,bias,0.672124982,impartial,rumor

Hollywood star Seagal and judo-loving Kremlin tough guy Putin have struck up a bromance in recent years, with Seagal visiting Russia repeatedly and defending Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. ‘He was asking quite insistently and over a lengthy period to be granted citizenship,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. ‘He is well known for his warm feelings towards our country and has never hidden them.’ DUAL CITIZENSHIP IN THE U.S. Americans are allowed to hold dual citizenship, such as Steven Seagal now has with Russia. U.S. law does not mention dual nationality not does it require its citizens to choose one nationality over the other. People that become U.S. citizens are asked to make a pledge of loyalty to the U.S., renouncing all previous allegiances, but the statement is more symbolic than contractual. However, there are rare cases in which a U.S. citizen can forfeit their citizenship by becoming the citizen of another nation. That can happen in instances when an American citizen joins the armed forces of a foreign nation or they make a declaration of allegiance to a foreign state with the express purpose of relinquishing their U.S. nationality. Seagal is the latest in a string of high-profile Westerners to be granted Russian citizenship after buddying up with Putin. Veteran French actor Gerard Depardieu was given a Russian passport in 2013 after the star became a tax exile in ire over rate hikes in his native country. Putin has also handed out citizenship to American boxer Roy Jones Jr after sipping tea with him in Crimea and to American mixed martial artist Jeff Monson. Seagal’s fame peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s with films such as ‘Under Siege’ and ‘Above the Law’, but he remains hugely popular in eastern Europe and was granted Serbian citizenship in January. Like Depardieu, he has previously hung out with Putin, a fellow martial arts fan, and other strongmen leaders from the former Soviet Union. After Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Seagal called Putin ‘one of the great living world leaders’ and even performed with his blues band in the annexed Black Sea peninsula. In August, veteran Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko made Seagal eat one of his homegrown carrots in an awkward encounter that drew mockery online.",english,2016-11-03T21:03:58.143+02:00,AM TV Media,US,,Putin grants Steven Seagal Russian citizenship,0,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/article-doc-hq4yp-vCzQrrGoE078947232bf09aa4ef-869_634x427.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs,0.745529652,impartial,0.955393374,impartial,rumor

He thinks that an intelligence worker may have hacked into the DNC emails due to concern about Hillary Clinton’s disregard of national security in her use of a personal email server and her continued lies about her activity. Once accessed, there’s no telling where the information could have gone.The “Putin did it” story is a fable used to sway voters towards Clinton’s war-driven agenda.On a talk radio show, he mentioned that there are numerous questions that are not being answered about the hacked DNC emails and the network log available to the NSA.Binney explains that there was no evidence tying the alleged Russian hacks to Wikileaks, and he says that they would have access to this information through the network logs. “So, if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and get them right now,” he said.He finds their reluctance to speak to this matter highly suspicious.Delivered by The Daily SheepleWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ).",english,2016-10-26T22:06:05.704+03:00,The Daily Sheeple,US,6659,"NSA Whistleblower Says DNC Email Hack Was Not by Russia, but by US Intelligence | Alternative",0,http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NSA-spying-in-your-computer.jpg,0,1,3,0,3,bs,0.163094521,bias,0.23716113,bias,conspiracy
